
This Project is developed in Node.js framework (more details can be found in package.json)
Since, this project uses Postgresql as db, make sure you have created an 'auth-system' db before you run the project.

It uses a client CLI python app written in Python 3.x

Community Health Worker can simply run/open the portal by typing: "python vtclient.py" (located inside the support folder)

Thanks for showing interest.
